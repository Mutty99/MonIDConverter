# MonIDConverter

This is a calculator and converter created to help people who want to RNG with 3DSRNGTool.
You can either input TID and SID, or G7TID and G7TID. The program will tell you:

- Your G7TID and G7SID if you input TID and SID, or viceversa.
- Your TSV (Trainer Shiny Value)
- Your TRV (Trainer Residual Value, for Square Shinies)

Thanks to the PKHex Development Projects discord server for helping me to put together the formulas needed.
